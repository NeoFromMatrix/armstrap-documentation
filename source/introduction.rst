Introduction
============

Armstrap a community of engineers and makers determined to help make ARM prototyping easy and fun. We focus on ease-of-use, helping real-world engineers bootstrap interactive objects or environments.

Armstrap boards are open-source electronics prototyping platforms centered on the powerful STM32F4 ARM processor. Each board can be built by hand or purchased preassembled; the software can be downloaded for free. The hardware reference designs (CAD files) are available under an MIT license, you are free to adapt them to your needs.

Our Goals:

- To provide an easy-to-use ARM development experience on Microsoft Windows, Apple Macs and Ubuntu Linux platforms.
- To provide open-source ARM development that enables real-world engineers to bootstrap any project.
- To have fun!
